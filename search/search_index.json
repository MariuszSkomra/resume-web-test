I am a QA with 8 years of experience in test automation, both creating new projects from scratch and developing existing ones.</p> <p>I have programming experience in Java, Kotlin and TypeScript. I have automated GUI, API and database tests using tools such as Selenium, Selenide, RestAssured and Playwright. I have worked with CI/CD tools, integrating them into test projects from scratch and developing existing solutions.</p> <p>In my day-to-day work I take a shift-left approach, engaging in conversations with developers, analysts and product owners to start testing at the earliest possible stage of project development.</p> <p>My experience includes working in senior teams as a standalone QA and in teams of people with varying levels of experience. I enjoy learning and exploring new tools and technologies, as well as the opportunity to share knowledge and experience.</p>"},{"location":"education/","title":"Education","text":""},{"location":"education/#certificates","title":"Certificates","text":"<ul> <li>International Software Testing Qualifications
